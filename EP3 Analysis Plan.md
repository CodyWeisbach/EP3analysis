# A Twitter Analysis of EP3 East

The [NOI](http://noigroup.com) EP3 East Conference recently ended. It was a great conference, but only about 150 of us got to experience it live.  

I was involved in live tweeting the event and it seemed like the twitter world was very interested in what was going on at the conference.  


Based on that interest, I want to do a post-conference analysis to summarize the twitter social media response. Therefore, I have collected all the tweets with the ep3east hashtag and stored them in a database.  


Like any analysis, itâ€™s best to share what you intend to do before you do it, so the those looking at the results can be confident that there is no cherry picking going on.  

## The Plan 

I thought it would be interesting to look at similar metrics for different time periods.

**Full Conference**

The first time period is all of the tweets for the conference as a whole.
 
**By Day**

Analyzing tweets on each day of the conference. 
 
* Day 1- December 2, 2016  
* Day 2- December 3, 2016  
* Day 3- December 4, 2016

**By Session**

The tweets for each session of the conference.   

The times here will be based on when the [@noigroup](https://twitter.com/noigroup) account tweeted out the start of the day, start of break or lunch, return from break or lunch, and the end of the day. Sessions will be separated out as follows.  

* Day 1: Start to the end of morning break
* Day 1: End of morning break to end of lunch
* Day 1: End of lunch to end of afternoon break
* Day 1: End of afternoon break to an hour after the end of the day
* An Hour after Finish of Day 1 to Start of Day 2
* Day 2: Start to the end of morning break
* Day 2: End of morning break to end of lunch
* Day 2: End of lunch to end of afternoon break
* Day 2: End of afternoon break to an hour after the end of the day
* Finish of Day 2 to Start of Day 3
* Day 3: Start to the end of morning break
* Day 3: End of morning break to end of lunch
* Day 3: End of lunch to end of afternoon break
* Day 3: End of afternoon break to an hour after the end of the day
* Finish of the conference to when data collection stopped

##Planned Analyses 


For each of these time periods, I will analyze the following.

**Total Number of tweets**  
The total Number of tweets per time period  

**Total Number tweets of favorited**  
The total number of tweets favorited in each time period

**Total Number of tweets retweeted**  
The total number of tweets that were retweeted for each time period

**Most important tweets**  
The most important tweets for each time period (which I will define as highest number of retweets + favorites) will be listed. Included will be...   

* The Top 10 tweets from the conference
* The Top 5 tweets from each day
* The Top tweet from each session

**Most tweeted terms**  
For the full conference and for each day, the most tweeted terms will be presented in a word cloud.
