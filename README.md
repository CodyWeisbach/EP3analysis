# A Twitter Analysis of EP3 East

The [NOI](http://noigroup.com) EP3 East Conference recently ended. It was a great conference, but only about 150 of us got to experience it live.  

I was involved in live tweeting the event and it seemed like the twitter world was very interested in what was going on at the conference.  


Based on that interest, I want to do a post-conference analysis to summarize the twitter social media response. Therefore, I have collected all the tweets with the ep3east hashtag and stored them in a database.  

## How to Look at This  

This analysis is directed towards PT's, which means that you are probably not used to looking at github or code, so I want to provide a little direction.  

Above you will see several files. Here is how I would recommend going through the files.  

### The Plan

Start with the "EP3 Analysis Plan.md"  
There is no code in that file. Just what I planned to do with the analysis. I wrote it because it's good practice to come up with a plan and execute on that plan when looking at data.  

### The Code

Next look at the file "EP3 Analysis- Full conference and By Date.ipynb"  
That is the file where I actually did the analysis. In the plan I mention that I am going to perform the analyses on each session, but for now I have only done it for the East and West conference in full, and for each of the three days. If there is interest, I'll do it by session analysis. Let me know via twitter [@CodyWeisbach](http://twitter.com/codyweisbach) if you are interested in seeing it.  

Since I'm assuming that you're not familiar with reading code, I've tried to be reasonably clear with what I'm doing each step along the way. If you have any questions about what I did, how I did it, etc contact me on twitter and I can try to help out.  

### The Charts

The remaining files are the charts that were made from the analyses above. All of the charts here are present in the main code document but they are saved individually for easier viewing.  

### Hope you find this interesting!
